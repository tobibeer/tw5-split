!! Operand

The operand of ''split[]'' defines the characters by which to split input titles.

!! Suffix

You can define a number of suffix elements some of which can be meaningfully combined, e.g:

`split:suffix suffix suffix[operand]`

; +
: adds the operand to the split titles
; +(string)
: appends `string` to the split titles
; (string)+
: prepends `string` to the split titles
; trim
: trims all blanks from split titles
; first
: returns the first title of the split
; !first
: returns all but the first title of the split
; last
: returns the last title of the split
; !last
: returns all but the last title of the split
; at
: splits the input title in two at the character specified as a number in the operand
: returns nothing should the input title be shorter than the specified number
; keep
: returns the title even if nothing was split
; $
: instead of the split titles, passes all those input titles that contained the operand
; $all
: instead of the split titles, if any of the input titles could be split by the operand, passes all input titles, unmodified
